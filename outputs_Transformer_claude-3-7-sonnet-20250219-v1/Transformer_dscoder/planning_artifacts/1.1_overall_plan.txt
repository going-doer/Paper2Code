# Reproduction Plan for "Attention Is All You Need" (Transformer Paper)

## Overview

This plan outlines how to reproduce the Transformer architecture and experiments described in the paper. The Transformer is a novel sequence transduction model that relies entirely on self-attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions.

## Part 1: Transformer Architecture Implementation

### 1. Model Architecture

The Transformer follows an encoder-decoder architecture with the following specifications:

#### 1.1 Overall Architecture
- **Encoder**: Stack of N=6 identical layers
- **Decoder**: Stack of N=6 identical layers
- **Output**: Linear layer + softmax for next-token prediction
- **Dimension**: All sub-layers output dimension d_model = 512

#### 1.2 Encoder Components
Each encoder layer has:
- Multi-head self-attention sub-layer
- Position-wise fully connected feed-forward network
- Residual connections around each sub-layer + layer normalization

#### 1.3 Decoder Components
Each decoder layer has:
- Masked multi-head self-attention sub-layer
- Multi-head attention over encoder output
- Position-wise fully connected feed-forward network
- Residual connections around each sub-layer + layer normalization
- Masking to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions

### 2. Key Components

#### 2.1 Attention Mechanism

**Scaled Dot-Product Attention**:
- Formula: Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T/√d_k)V
- Inputs: Queries and keys of dimension d_k, values of dimension d_v
- Scaling factor: 1/√d_k to prevent small gradients in softmax

**Multi-Head Attention**:
- Perform attention function h times in parallel
- Parameters:
  - Number of heads h = 8
  - Dimension per head d_k = d_v = d_model/h = 64
- Projection matrices:
  - W_Q^i ∈ R^(d_model×d_k)
  - W_K^i ∈ R^(d_model×d_k)
  - W_V^i ∈ R^(d_model×d_v)
  - W_O ∈ R^(hd_v×d_model)

#### 2.2 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks
- Two linear transformations with ReLU activation:
  - FFN(x) = max(0, xW_1 + b_1)W_2 + b_2
- Parameters:
  - Input and output dimensionality: d_model = 512
  - Inner layer dimensionality: d_ff = 2048

#### 2.3 Embeddings and Positional Encoding
- Token embeddings: Learned embeddings of dimension d_model = 512
- Positional encodings: Using sine and cosine functions
  - PE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/10000^(2i/d_model))
  - PE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/10000^(2i/d_model))
- Position embeddings added to token embeddings
- Embedding weights multiplied by √d_model
- Weight sharing between embedding layers and pre-softmax linear transformation

#### 2.4 Regularization Techniques
- Residual dropout: Applied to each sub-layer output before addition and normalization, P_drop = 0.1
- Embedding dropout: Applied to sums of embeddings and positional encodings
- Label smoothing: ϵ_ls = 0.1
