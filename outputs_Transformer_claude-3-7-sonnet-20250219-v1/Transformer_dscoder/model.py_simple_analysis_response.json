[{"text": "# Logic Analysis for model.py\n\n## Overview\nThe `model.py` file will implement the core Transformer architecture as described in the paper \"Attention Is All You Need\". This module is responsible for defining the complete model structure including positional encoding, multi-head attention, feed-forward networks, encoder and decoder layers, and the full Transformer model.\n\n## Positional Encoding\n\n### Class: `PositionalEncoding`\nThis class implements the positional encoding mechanism described in Section 3.5 of the paper.\n\n#### Logic Flow:\n1. Initialize with model dimension, dropout rate, and maximum sequence length\n2. Create a position encoding tensor of shape (max_len, d_model) using sine and cosine functions\n3. For even indices (2i), use sine function: `PE(pos, 2i) = sin(pos / 10000^(2i/d_model))`\n4. For odd indices (2i+1), use cosine function: `PE(pos, 2i+1) = cos(pos / 10000^(2i/d_model))`\n5. Store this tensor as a buffer (not a parameter) in the module\n6. In the forward pass:\n   - Take input embeddings x of shape (batch_size, seq_len, d_model)\n   - Add positional encodings (sliced to match sequence length)\n   - Apply dropout\n   - Return the result\n\n## Multi-Head Attention\n\n### Class: `MultiHeadAttention`\nThis class implements the multi-head attention mechanism described in Section 3.2.2 of the paper.\n\n#### Logic Flow:\n1. Initialize with model dimension, number of heads, and dropout rate\n2. Calculate dimensions for each head: d_k = d_v = d_model / n_heads\n3. Create linear projections for queries, keys, values, and output:\n   - W_q: d_model \u2192 d_model (will be reshaped per head)\n   - W_k: d_model \u2192 d_model (will be reshaped per head)\n   - W_v: d_model \u2192 d_model (will be reshaped per head)\n   - W_o: d_model \u2192 d_model\n4. Implement `attention` method (scaled dot-product attention):\n   - Compute dot products of queries and keys: QK^T\n   - Scale by 1/\u221ad_k\n   - Apply mask to set masked positions to -\u221e (or a very large negative value)\n   - Apply softmax to get attention weights\n   - Compute weighted sum of values\n   - Return attention output and attention weights\n5. In the forward pass:\n   - Project queries, keys, values using respective projections\n   - Reshape to separate batch_size, seq_len, n_heads, d_k dimensions\n   - Transpose to get shape (batch_size, n_heads, seq_len, d_k)\n   - Apply scaled dot-product attention to get attention outputs\n   - Transpose and reshape back to original dimensions\n   - Apply final output projection W_o\n   - Apply dropout\n   - Return attention output\n\n## Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\n\n### Class: `PositionwiseFeedforward`\nImplements the position-wise feed-forward network described in Section 3.3 of the paper.\n\n#### Logic Flow:\n1. Initialize with model dimension, feed-forward dimension, and dropout rate\n2. Create two linear transformations:\n   - linear1: d_model \u2192 d_ff\n   - linear2: d_ff \u2192 d_model\n3. In the forward pass:\n   - Apply first linear transformation to input\n   - Apply ReLU activation\n   - Apply dropout\n   - Apply second linear transformation\n   - Apply dropout again\n   - Return the result\n\n## Encoder Layer\n\n### Class: `EncoderLayer`\nImplements a single encoder layer as described in Section 3.1 of the paper.\n\n#### Logic Flow:\n1. Initialize with model dimension, number of heads, feed-forward dimension, and dropout rate\n2. Create components:\n   - self_attn: MultiHeadAttention for self-attention\n   - feed_forward: PositionwiseFeedforward\n   - norm1, norm2: Layer normalization modules\n3. In the forward pass:\n   - Apply self-attention with residual connection and layer normalization:\n     - attn_output = self_attn(x, x, x, mask)\n     - x = norm1(x + dropout(attn_output))\n   - Apply feed-forward network with residual connection and layer normalization:\n     - ff_output = feed_forward(x)\n     - x = norm2(x + dropout(ff_output))\n   - Return the result\n\n## Decoder Layer\n\n### Class: `DecoderLayer`\nImplements a single decoder layer as described in Section 3.1 of the paper.\n\n#### Logic Flow:\n1. Initialize with model dimension, number of heads, feed-forward dimension, and dropout rate\n2. Create components:\n   - self_attn: MultiHeadAttention for masked self-attention\n   - cross_attn: MultiHeadAttention for encoder-decoder attention\n   - feed_forward: PositionwiseFeedforward\n   - norm1, norm2, norm3: Layer normalization modules\n3. In the forward pass:\n   - Apply masked self-attention with residual connection and layer normalization:\n     - attn_output = self_attn(x, x, x, tgt_mask)\n     - x = norm1(x + dropout(attn_output))\n   - Apply encoder-decoder attention with residual connection and layer normalization:\n     - attn_output = cross_attn(x, memory, memory, src_mask)\n     - x = norm2(x + dropout(attn_output))\n   - Apply feed-forward network with residual connection and layer normalization:\n     - ff_output = feed_forward(x)\n     - x = norm3(x + dropout(ff_output))\n   - Return the result\n\n## Transformer Model\n\n### Class: `TransformerModel`\nImplements the complete Transformer model as described in Section 3 of the paper.\n\n#### Logic Flow:\n1.
