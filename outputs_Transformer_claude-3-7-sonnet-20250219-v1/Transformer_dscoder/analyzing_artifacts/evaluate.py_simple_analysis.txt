# Logic Analysis for evaluate.py

## Purpose and Scope
This module is responsible for evaluating a trained Transformer model, computing performance metrics, and handling inference tasks like translation. The primary functionality revolves around:

1. Model inference using beam search for translation
2. Computing BLEU scores to evaluate translation quality
3. Averaging model checkpoints for improved performance
4. Providing utilities for single sentence translation

## Class Structure: Evaluator

### Class Initialization
```python
def __init__(config: Config, model: TransformerModel, data_processor: DataProcessor)
```

The initialization should:
1. Store the transformer model instance
2. Store the data processor for tokenization and vocabulary access
3. Configure beam search parameters from config:
   - `beam_size` (default: 4 from config.yaml)
   - `length_penalty` (default: 0.6 from config.yaml)
   - `max_length_factor` (default: 50 from config.yaml)
4. Set the device (CPU or GPU) to match the model
5. Save special token indices (start_token, end_token, pad_token) from the data processor vocabularies

### Method: evaluate(test_data: DataLoader) -> dict

This method evaluates the model on a test dataset and computes metrics:

Logic flow:
1. Set the model to evaluation mode
2. Initialize lists to store references and hypotheses
3. Iterate through test_data batches:
   - For each batch, get source and target tensors
   - Create necessary masks for attention
   - Generate translations using beam search
   - Convert token IDs to text for both references and hypotheses
   - Store the results
4. Calculate BLEU score using the stored references and hypotheses
5. Return a dictionary containing metrics:
   - BLEU score
   - Number of examples evaluated
   - Additional metrics if needed (e.g., average translation length)

The implementation needs to handle:
- Batch processing of data with attention masks
- Converting tensor outputs from beam search to readable text
- Maintaining proper references and hypotheses lists for BLEU calculation

### Method: translate_sentence(sentence: str) -> str

This method translates a single sentence from source language to target language:

Logic flow:
1. Tokenize and preprocess the input sentence using the data processor
2. Convert tokens to tensor and add batch dimension
3. Create source mask for attention
4. Use beam search to generate translation
5. Convert output token IDs back to text
6. Return the translated sentence as a string

This method should:
- Handle unknown tokens in the input
- Apply proper preprocessing (BPE or wordpiece) through the data processor
- Remove any special tokens from the output (like EOS tokens)
- Return a clean, readable translation

### Method: compute_bleu(references: List[str], hypotheses: List[str]) -> float

Logic flow:
1. Format references and hypotheses for sacrebleu:
   - References should be a list of lists (multiple references per translation)
   - Hypotheses should be a flat list
2. Use sacrebleu to compute the BLEU score
3. Return the corpus BLEU score as a float

Implementation details:
- Use sacrebleu's corpus_bleu function for BLEU calculation
- Format references correctly even if there's only one reference per translation
- Return the score value (not the object) for easy reporting

### Method: average_checkpoints(paths: List[str]) -> None

This method implements checkpoint averaging for improved inference, which was mentioned in the paper:

Logic flow:
1. Load the first checkpoint to get the model structure
2. Initialize a dictionary to store the sum of all parameter tensors
3. For each checkpoint path:
   - Load the checkpoint state dictionary
   - Add each parameter tensor to the running sum
4. Divide all summed parameters by the number of checkpoints
5. Load the averaged parameters into the model

Implementation details:
- Handle different model structures if necessary
- Maintain proper device placement for tensors
- This method should modify the model in-place

## Beam Search Implementation

While the main beam search is implemented in the TransformerModel class (as specified in the design), the evaluator will need to properly use it:

1. Determine max_len based on input length + max_length_factor (50 by default)
2. Call model.beam_search with proper parameters:
   - Source tensor
   - Max length
   - Start token index
   - Beam size
   - Length penalty alpha
3. Process the beam search output to get the best translation

## Constraints and Dependencies

1. **Model State**: The model must be in evaluation mode during inference (no dropout)
2. **Data Processing**: Must use the same data processor used during training for consistent tokenization
3. **Config Parameters**: Must respect configuration settings for beam size and length penalty
4. **BLEU Calculation**: Must use sacrebleu for consistent BLEU calculation as in literature
5. **Checkpoint Format**: Needs to handle PyTorch state dictionaries properly

## Integration with Other Components

1. **Model Integration**: The evaluator needs to interface with the TransformerModel's beam_search method
2. **Data Processor Integration**: Must use the data processor for consistent tokenization and vocabulary handling
3. **Utils Integration**: Uses the average_checkpoints utility for model averaging

## Error Handling Considerations

1. Handle cases where model produces no valid translation (e.g., all outputs are invalid or shorter than minimum length)
2. Handle tensor device mismatches gracefully
3. Provide informative error messages for missing checkpoints or invalid paths
4. Handle cases where input sentences might be too long for the model's position encoding limit

## Performance Considerations

1. Batch processing for faster evaluation on test sets
2. Proper device management (GPU/CPU) for tensor operations
3. Progress tracking with tqdm for long evaluations

## Specific Requirements from Paper

1. Use beam search with beam size = 4
2. Apply length penalty with alpha = 0.6
3. Set maximum output length to input_length + 50
4. For base models, average last 5 checkpoints
5. For big models, average last 20 checkpoints
6. Terminate beam search early when possible (when EOS token is generated)

This implementation aligns with the approach described in the Transformer paper, particularly the evaluation methods mentioned in Section 6.1, paragraph 3.
